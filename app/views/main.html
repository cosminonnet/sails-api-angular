        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Angular <span class="text-muted">is a framework for building enhanced web apps.</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">Angular is built around the belief that declarative programming should be used for building UIs and wiring software components, while imperative programming is excellent for expressing business logic. The framework adapts and extends traditional HTML to better serve dynamic content through two-way data-binding that allows for the automatic synchronization of models and views. As a result, AngularJS deemphasizes DOM manipulation and improves testability.</p>

        <p class="lead">It is designed to mimic the MVC pattern of frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the requirements of modern apps like data-driven APIs with scalable, service-oriented architecture.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Mongo <span class="text-muted">is the leading open-source NoSQL database.</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">Mongo is a cross-platform document-oriented database system that eschews the traditional table-based relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, making the integration of data in certain types of applications easier and faster.</p>
